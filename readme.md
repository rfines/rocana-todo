# Simple Todo List Application For Rocana Interview Process
#### Written By Robert Fines on 10-20-2016


This is a simple application to illustrate my command of React/Redux for an interview with Rocana.

To run the application locally you will need to do the following:

  `npm install`
  `npm run build`

And then open the index.html file in your browser. All dependencies will load automatically and the app should work just fine for the limited required functionality.

The requirements were:

>bring the todo list to life!
   - clicking 'add item' should add the text from the new item input box to the bottom of the todo list
   - clicking the 'done' button should put an item into the 'done' state
   - clicking the delete item 'x' button should delete the item from the todo list
  Feel free to:
   - import any client-side libraries
   - create any additional javascript, stylesheet, etc
   - the .html page should load all external files without the use of a web server
   - it needs to work in Chrome, Firefox, Safari and IE11+
